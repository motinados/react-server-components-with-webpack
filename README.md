# react-server-components-with-webpack

This is a repository I created for studying React Server Components (RSC).
I wrote code by mixing the following two repositories.

- [simple-rsc](https://github.com/bholmesdev/simple-rsc)
- [server-components-demo](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo)

Much of my code is based on “simple-rsc”, and I referred to the webpack build part from “server component demo”.
By comparing and deciphering the code, I gained a deeper understanding.
However, to be honest, there’s still a lot I don’t know.
If you’re planning to learn RSC, I strongly recommend checking out the above-mentioned repositories before my code.
